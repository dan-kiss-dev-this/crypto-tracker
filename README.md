## README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Project
CryptoLive is a easy way to watch the price action and news of the 7 most popular cryptos. It was built with a focus on using React, Redux, API's and CSS to achieve data visualization and presentation. It features responsive design to work on both mobile and desktop screen sizes. It is a single page app and a lot of focus has been put into building code with semantic clarity as well.

Idea's for later development: Use env file for additional privacy. You need to make the key name start with 'REACT_APP_' in the project root directory so REACT_APP_SECRET_KEY = 123456  
console.log(process.env) to see your keys.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
